# Information about FIM 

First Project

I recently found interest in FIM and wanted to get to work. Days of research and failure I finally managed to create a FIM that let's me know whenever one of my files is changed/accessed by anyone that's not authorzied. Below is a chart explaining what I created, how it works, and what it will output;

!!! I plan on explaining/going more in depth about every step of the process at a later time... !!!


## Requirements  
It's a relatively easy project that doesn't require to download anything, all you need is: 

*Windows PowerShell ISE*
