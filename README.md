# Information about FIM

This is my first project, I hope I'm doing this correctly. I recently found interest in FIM and wanted to get to work. Days of research and failure I finally managed to create a FIM that let's me know whenever one of my files is changed/accessed. Below is a chart explaining what I created, how it work, and what it will output.
